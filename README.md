Welcome to Textspresso! I am building a cutting-edge messaging application, referred to as Whatsapp 2.0, using NEXT.JS.
This project aims to provide an enhanced user experience with features like 1-1 messaging, live status updates, and utilizes technologies such as React.js, Styled-Components, and Firebase. 

### Project Description
Textspresso is a real-time messaging application that enables users to engage in seamless conversations with others.
I aim to deliver a user-friendly and visually appealing interface by leveraging the power of NEXT.JS, a React framework for server-side rendering and static site generation.

The core features of Textspresso include:

1. **1-1 Messaging:** Users can exchange messages with their contacts in real-time. The application ensures smooth and efficient communication for a seamless chatting experience.
2. **Live Status Updates:** Users can view the online/offline status of their contacts in real-time, allowing them to know when their friends are available for a conversation.
3. **Styled-Components:** Textspresso employs Styled-Components to enable easy styling and customization of components. This approach provides a modular and maintainable structure for the application's design.
4. **React.js Integration:** The project utilizes React.js, a popular JavaScript library, to create reusable and interactive UI components, ensuring a responsive and dynamic user interface.
5. **Firebase Integration:** Textspresso is powered by Firebase, a comprehensive platform that provides backend infrastructure and services. Firebase enables real-time data synchronization, secure user authentication and effortless data storage.
